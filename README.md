The Forge Network


ForgeNet aims to bring users a complete, decentralised cryptocurrency ecosystem. By that, we mean, that the aim is to bring users a cryptocurrency that does not cater to any one niche group. We cater to the whole populace. We wish to be truly community driven. Usability, mobility, ease of use, quick transactions, low fees, and mobile staking are the first things we wish to bring to our community.


We present a PoW (ended at block 10,000 – it was meant to kickstart and boost our initial network process) and PoS hybrid. We strive to bring the users quick transaction speeds along with low fees, private transactions, full nodes and mobile nodes, mobile staking, a thriving marketplace, and an all-inclusive mobile app. A truly mobile cryptocurrency for a generation that is on the go.


We aren’t forgetting those who still use their personal computers. We will still remain focused and up to date on all Linux and Windows tools with Mac concepts being considered and web wallets for those who need it. Our goal is to make this the go-to for all. What we offer is bringing as much as possible to the table and centralizing it into one cryptocurrency, all the while, ensuring ease-of-use for everyone.




================================================================




	Development is still young and while the Forge Network is live and providing lightning speeds, we need to continue to upgrade the system for scalability and versatility as we tackle challenges within our target markets.  

	This initial git push will serve as the official release of the stable version of the Forge Network and offer insight into development steps as we move forward.  Our team is relatively small and working on several exciting aspects that we feel will be worth it in the long run but this may create delays in pushes.  We should see this improve over time as our team grows. 

     Thank you to everyone who stuck with us and to those who will continue to do so in the future.  Forge is a long hold, but I hope I can make it worth the wait!

Hodl!
